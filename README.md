# Customer Segmentation using K-Means

This project segments customers based on spending and income behavior using unsupervised learning (K-Means Clustering). It demonstrates how businesses can use clustering techniques to group customers for targeted marketing strategies.

## ðŸ“Š Features

- Simulated customer data (can be replaced with real-world data)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- K-Means Clustering
- Elbow Method to determine optimal clusters
- PCA for 2D visualization of high-dimensional clusters
- Visualizations saved as PNG files

## ðŸ§° Tools Used

- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included

- `customer_segmentation_colab.ipynb`: The main notebook
- `customer_distribution.png`, `elbow_method.png`, `customer_segments.png`, `pca_clusters.png`: Visualizations

## ðŸ”„ Customization

Replace the simulated dataset with real customer data to apply in real-world freelancing scenarios.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter.
2. Run all cells to see clustering and visualization results.
